        <h1>The Windows To Your Soul</h1>
        <h2>By Victory Amede</h2>
        <p>Whose <strong>eyes</strong> are those? I may know <br> Their owner is quite <em>happy</em> <br> Full of joy like an arresting rainbow <br></p>
        <p> I watch her laugh as I yelp hello <br> She gives her eyes a <em>dazzling</em> shake <br> As she laughs until her belly aches <br> The only other sounds that break are of <br> Hallowing winds and ocean waves </p>
        <p> Her eyes are <strong>youthful, sparkly and deep</strong> <br> She has promises to keep her face so meek <br> She rests in her plush bed <br> Wild thoughts running through her head <br> Ready for the day break ahead </p>
